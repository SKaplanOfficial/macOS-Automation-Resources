# macOS Automation Resources

This is a collection of resources for macOS automation technologies. The resources have been organized by type, but there is otherwise no specific order to them. I recommend using Command+F to find materials relevant to your needs.

For each resource, links are provided for both the live website, where possible, and a [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) archive, where reasonable.

Have questions or comments? Open an [issue](https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/macOS-Automation-Resources/issues/new/choose) or email [stephen@mac-nerd.org](mailto:stephen@mac-nerd.org).

Contributions welcome!
